# getDogs.io
The purpose of this repo is to practice fetching data using React and an API. Since I recently picked up a European Doberman, I selected to use the Dog API and make an app that allows to look a dog pictures based on breed. 

I first make a call to list all breeds endpoint to create a select drop down allowing the user to select the dog of choice. Upon selecting a dog breed, the application will make another call using Dog API to retrieve and array of images for that selected breed. Additionally, pagination has been added for a better user experience especially when there are lots of images to load on the page.
